## Project: AR Touchpad

An Android app that turns a phone's touchscreen into a trackpad for Android desktop mode on Viture XR Pro glasses (or any USB-C DisplayPort display). Tested on Pixel 10 + Viture XR Pro running Android 16.

- **Package:** `com.pgratz.artouchpad`
- **Min SDK:** 34 (Android 14), target arm64-v8a only
- **Language:** Kotlin + C++ (JNI)
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose + Material3

## Build Commands

Run from the project root (where `gradlew` lives):

```bash
# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release APK (requires signing keys in local.properties)
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Install debug APK on connected device
./gradlew installDebug

# Lint
./gradlew lint

# Clean
./gradlew clean
```

The NDK CMake build compiles `libartouchpad.so` automatically alongside the Kotlin build.

There are no unit or instrumented tests (`src/test` and `src/androidTest` don't exist); verification is manual on device.

## Setup Requirements

- Android Studio (provides SDK, NDK, Gradle)
- NDK r25+ (installed via Android Studio SDK Manager)
- `local.properties` at project root with `sdk.dir=/home/pgratz/Android/Sdk`
- For release builds, add signing keys to `local.properties`: `KEYSTORE_PATH`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS`, `KEY_PASSWORD`

Runtime on device:
- [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) installed (grants shell uid = `input` group = `/dev/uinput` access).
  The app starts it by itself — see "Starting Shizuku" below — so no computer is needed after a
  one-time pairing.
- Wireless debugging enabled in developer options; that is what the app talks to.
- Accessibility Service enabled in Settings → Accessibility → AR Touchpad

## Architecture

The app has two processes: the normal app process and a Shizuku UserService process (shell uid).

```
app/src/main/
  aidl/…/IMouseService.aidl         — Binder interface between app and Shizuku service
  cpp/uinput_jni.cpp                 — JNI: opens /dev/uinput, calls ioctl, writes input_events
  java/…/
    MouseService.kt                  — Shizuku UserService (shell uid): owns the uinput fd
    ShizukuMouseController.kt        — App-side: binds/unbinds MouseService, rate-limits IPC to ~60 Hz
    TouchpadViewModel.kt             — State, display detection, gesture dispatch, smoothing filter
    UinputNative.kt                  — Kotlin object declaring external JNI functions
    TouchpadAccessibilityService.kt  — Handles nav bar actions; detects external text focus
    adb/AdbConnectionManager.kt      — RSA key + self-signed cert this app shows to adbd
    adb/ShizukuBootstrap.kt          — Connects to the device's own adbd, runs Shizuku's starter
    adb/AdbPairingService.kt         — One-time pairing, code collected via a notification reply
    ui/TouchpadScreen.kt             — Compose UI: status bar, touch surface, keyboard proxy, nav bar
```

### Data flow

1. `TouchpadSurface` (Compose) intercepts raw pointer events and classifies them into gestures (tap, drag, two-finger scroll/pinch, long-press-drag for text select).
2. Gesture callbacks hit `TouchpadViewModel`, which applies velocity-adaptive exponential smoothing to cursor movement and maintains `TouchpadState` via `StateFlow`.
3. `TouchpadViewModel` delegates to `ShizukuMouseController`, which rate-limits IPC to ~60 Hz (accumulating deltas between frames) and calls through to `IMouseService`.
4. `MouseService` (shell uid) either writes `input_event` structs to `/dev/uinput` (for cursor/scroll/button) or uses `InputManagerGlobal.injectInputEvent` reflection (for key events and Ctrl+scroll zoom).

### Key design constraints

**JNI for uinput:** Android 16 removed the generic `Os.ioctl(fd, req, value)` variant. The JNI bridge in `uinput_jni.cpp` is the only reliable way to call `ioctl` with an arbitrary value argument for `UI_SET_EVBIT`, `UI_SET_RELBIT`, etc.

**Reflection for key injection:** `InputManagerGlobal.injectInputEvent` and `InputEvent.setDisplayId` are hidden APIs. They're accessed via reflection, gated by HiddenApiBypass library, and lint suppression is set in `build.gradle.kts` (`BlockedPrivateApi`).

**Shizuku UserService versioning:** `userServiceArgs.version(17)` in `ShizukuMouseController` is bumped whenever the `IMouseService.aidl` interface changes (adding methods). AIDL method IDs are explicit integers — new methods must append to avoid breaking existing bindings. `destroy() = 16777114` is Shizuku's reserved destroy transaction ID; never renumber it.

**Cursor-to-display association:** `MouseService.setDisplay()` pins the uinput device to the target display via `InputManagerGlobal.setInputDeviceDisplayAssociation` (reflection, with a fallback through the raw `IInputManager` binder in the `mIm` field). Without this, Android may route the virtual mouse to the phone's display. The device is found by scanning `InputDevice`s for the name `"AR Touchpad Mouse"` after a 400 ms registration delay.

**Two-finger gesture disambiguation:** `TouchpadSurface` compares `|dSpan|` vs `|dx| + |dy|` each frame to decide pinch vs. scroll. Pinch threshold crossing triggers `Ctrl+scroll` MotionEvents (200 px per detent) for content-level zoom in Chrome/WebView.

**Text selection flow:** Long-press (600 ms, haptic) → drag moves cursor with `BTN_LEFT` held → release calls `mouseUp()` + `pressKeyWithCtrl(KEYCODE_C)` to auto-copy. A second finger during select drag cancels selection (`onSelectEnd()`).

**Text input (two paths):** Primary is DeX-style direct typing: `MouseService.setImePolicy` calls `IWindowManager.setDisplayImePolicy(displayId, FALLBACK)` via reflection (shell uid holds the required `INTERNAL_SYSTEM_WINDOW` permission; there is no `wm` shell subcommand for this), so a field focused on the glasses shows Gboard on the phone while the InputConnection stays with the field — every keystroke lands directly. Applied in `TouchpadViewModel.applyImePolicy` when the external display is detected, gated by the persisted `dexKeyboardEnabled` preference, restored to `local` in `onCleared()`. `dexKeyboardActive` in state reflects whether the call actually worked on this build. Fallback (when the command is unsupported or the toggle is off): the keyboard proxy — an editable-field focus on the glasses (detected via `AccessibilityEvent.TYPE_VIEW_FOCUSED` with `window.displayId != DEFAULT_DISPLAY`) shows a phone-side `EditText` strip; text accumulates on the phone, then is injected via `typeText` + `pressKey(ENTER)` after a 200 ms IME teardown delay, with a delayed BACK press dismissing the glasses-side IME.

**Starting Shizuku:** Shizuku hands out the shell privileges everything above depends on, but it
can only be started by something that already has them, so it is dead after every reboot. Its own
"start on boot" needs root. Instead the app connects to *this device's own* `adbd` — it listens on
every interface, loopback included — as an ordinary ADB client and runs
`<shizuku nativeLibraryDir>/libshizuku.so --apk=<shizuku sourceDir>`, the same command Shizuku's
own starter uses. `TouchpadViewModel.startShizukuIfNeeded()` fires from `MainActivity.onResume`,
so opening the app is the whole procedure.

Trust is established once: `adbd` keeps the app's public key in `/data/misc/adb/adb_keys` across
reboots and refreshes its timestamp on every connection, so it never expires. The pairing code is
collected through a **notification reply**, not a screen of the app's own — measured on device, the
system stops advertising `_adb-tls-pairing._tcp` the moment its own pairing dialog leaves the
foreground, so a window asking for the code would cancel the thing it was asking about. Pulling
down the notification shade leaves that dialog alive. Shizuku's own `AdbPairingService` does this
for the same reason.

Two constraints worth not rediscovering: wireless debugging only comes up **after the screen is
unlocked** following a reboot (before that every port refuses the connection), which is why the
start hangs off `onResume` rather than `BOOT_COMPLETED`; and Shizuku genuinely cannot be replaced
by granting this app permissions directly — `/dev/uinput` carries the SELinux label `uhid_device`,
for which `untrusted_app` has no rule at all, and `INTERNAL_SYSTEM_WINDOW` is `signature|module`.

**Settings persistence:** `sensitivity` (default 0.5), `scrollSpeed`, `naturalScroll`, and `dexKeyboardEnabled` live in SharedPreferences `touchpad_prefs`, loaded into the initial `TouchpadState` and written in the ViewModel setters.
